# Welcome to CNETCITIES! 🌐

**Are you lost?** 🌀

This project is an attempt to create a study guide for the **Computer Networking Technology (CNET)** program I'm enrolled in.

But as you've probably noticed, I am doing so in a manner that reflects the **Old Web**—as in the days of *Geocities, Angelfire,* and *Expage*—when I was growing up and learning to patch together HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to make aesthetically pleasing sites for myself and my friends. 

Almost all of those old experiments are lost now, or at least beyond my ability to recover, so many email addresses and years ago, but making them never got old.

Basically, **CNETCITIES** is meant to be:
- Eye-catching 🎨
- Tacky 🤡
- Fun 🎉
- Silly 😜
- But also **informative** 📚

If it does anyone else any good, I consider that a bonus. 🎁
