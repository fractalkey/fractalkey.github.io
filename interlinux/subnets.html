    <h2>My Own Formulae</h2>
    <h3>Determining Bits to Borrow</h3>
    <p>Ever wondered how many bits you need to borrow to create the subnets you desire? Here's the secret formula:</p>
    <p><strong>2^b = r</strong>, where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>b</strong> = bits to borrow (because stealing bits is the network admin's pastime)</li>
        <li><strong>r</strong> = required subnets (the magic number you're after)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Solving for <strong>b</strong> is like finding the password to your network's secret club. Remember, if <strong>r</strong> isn't a power of 2, you might need to round up or reconsider your life choices.</p>

    <h3>Calculating Usable Hosts</h3>
    <p>Want to know how many devices you can plug into your freshly baked subnet? Here's how to do it:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with the total bits in IPv4, which is <strong>32</strong>. (Because the universe runs on 32-bit magic.)</li>
        <li>Subtract the new prefix length (your fancy subnet mask) to get the number of host bits, let's call it <strong>n</strong>.</li>
        <li>Plug <strong>n</strong> into <strong>2^n - 2</strong> to find out how many usable hosts you've got. The "-2" accounts for the network address and broadcast address, because they're like the bouncers of your subnet party; they're there, but you don't want to use them for dancing.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And there you have it, the magic formula for hosting a subnet party where everyone gets an IP!</p>
